# Javascript-Homework


Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, we appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Used a date form in the HTML document and  written the code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
